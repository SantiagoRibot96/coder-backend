# Entregas de Ribot Santiago

1) npm install: Install all dependencies needed to run the project
2) npm run dev: This will start nodemmon in app.js
3) first of all, the script creates products.json. Then the server is open for requests

type http://localhost:8080 in your browser. Then:

- http://localhost:8080/products will answer with all the products
- http://localhost:8080/products?limit=X will answer with X products
- http://localhost:8080/products/:pid will answer with the product pid. For example http://localhost:8080/products/4
